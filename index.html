                Hi, Iâ€™m Tristan, a developer driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and a desire to build tools that genuinely help people. 
                My goal is to grow into a role where I can solve meaningful problems through clean, maintainable code and thoughtful design. 
                Whether itâ€™s front-end interfaces or back-end systems, I enjoy understanding how things work and finding better ways to make them work well.
                <br> 
                <br>
                I come from a family of technology enthusiasts, so tech has always been part of my world. 
                My husband Nathan is also a developer and lifelong gamer, and our shared love of code and games keeps me constantly inspired. 
                Being surrounded by problem-solvers has shaped how I think, collaborate, and approach challenges with persistence and creativity.
                Outside of work, I love reading fantasy novels, exploring new games, and diving into strategy titles, interests that keep my mind sharp and my creativity active. 
                Whether Iâ€™m writing code or planning my next in-game strategy, Iâ€™m always thinking critically and looking for patterns.
                <br>
                <br>
                Iâ€™m currently a junior developer transitioning into tech after nine years in team leadership. 
                I recently earned an Associateâ€™s Degree in Computer Science and hold certifications in Web Development, Software Development, and Computer Programming Fundamentals. 
                I'm especially passionate about backend development, automation, and data analysis, and Iâ€™m excited to continue learning and honing my skills as a developer.
