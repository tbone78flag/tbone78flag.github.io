    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, I’m Tristan—a developer driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and the desire to build tools that genuinely help people. My career goal is to grow into a role where I can solve meaningful problems through clean, maintainable code and thoughtful design. Whether it’s front-end interfaces or back-end systems, I enjoy digging into how things work and finding better ways to make them work well.
        I come from a family of technology enthusiasts, so tech has always been part of my world. My husband Nathan is also a developer and lifelong gamer, and our shared love for code and games keeps me constantly inspired. Being surrounded by problem-solvers has helped shape how I think, collaborate, and approach challenges with persistence and creativity.
        Outside of work, I love reading fantasy novels, exploring new games, and diving into strategy titles -- interests that keep my mind sharp and my creativity active. Whether I’m writing code or planning my next in-game strategy, I’m always thinking critically and looking for patterns.
        I’m excited to keep learning, keep building, and find my place on a team where I can contribute, grow, and make a real impact.
        <br>
        <br>
        I’m currently a junior developer transitioning from 9 years of team leadership into tech. 
        I recently earned my Associate’s Degree in Computer Science and hold certifications in Web Development, Software Development, and Computer Programming Fundamentals.
        I'm passionate about backend development, automation, and data analysis.
        I am excited to continue my learning journey and honing my skills as a developer.
