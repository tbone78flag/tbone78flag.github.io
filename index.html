                Hi, I’m Tristan—a developer driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and a desire to build tools that genuinely help people. 
                My goal is to grow into a role where I can solve meaningful problems through clean, maintainable code and thoughtful design. 
                Whether it’s front-end interfaces or back-end systems, I enjoy understanding how things work and finding better ways to make them work well.
                <br> 
                <br>
                I come from a family of technology enthusiasts, so tech has always been part of my world. 
                My husband Nathan is also a developer and lifelong gamer, and our shared love of code and games keeps me constantly inspired. 
                Being surrounded by problem-solvers has shaped how I think, collaborate, and approach challenges—with persistence and creativity.
                Outside of work, I love reading fantasy novels, exploring new games, and diving into strategy titles—interests that keep my mind sharp and my creativity active. 
                Whether I’m writing code or planning my next in-game strategy, I’m always thinking critically and looking for patterns.
                <br>
                <br>
                I’m currently a junior developer transitioning into tech after nine years in team leadership. 
                I recently earned an Associate’s Degree in Computer Science and hold certifications in Web Development, Software Development, and Computer Programming Fundamentals. 
                I'm especially passionate about backend development, automation, and data analysis, and I’m excited to continue learning and honing my skills as a developer.
